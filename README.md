## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- How to work with Flexbox.
- Making webpages responsive without using media queries, using the clamp function.
- Nesting flexboxes after looking at various spacings of elements.
- 

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  padding: clamp(1.5rem, 8vw, 2.5rem);
  width: clamp(14rem, 80vw, 24rem);
}
```

### Continued development

- Must learn how to plan out in advance what I must do by looking at the required design.
- Must learn more responsive design concepts.
- Must use Figma dev tools better.


### Useful resources
